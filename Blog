Day 1 -> Did it in go. The question was pretty easy, but it took me a long time since I'm new to go.
Go's fun though.

Day 8 -> Very easy.

Day 9 -> Simple problem that took me forever to get right.

Day 15 -> Surprisingly easy. Huh.

Day 17 -> Part 1 was straight forward.
         Part 2, I tried to brute force it by optimizing a little.
         Then realized that you don't need the buffer at all and that you just need to keep track of the first value, saving time on expensive split operations.

Day 22 -> A sort of cellular automata?
          Fun!

Day 23 -> Part 1 was easy while part 2 was somewhat challeging.
          Figured out that there's several layers of loop but didn't piece it together.
          Saw some hints and realized that I loop all numbers between a and b by the inner jump offset (17)
          and increment h if it's prime.
          Pretty fun though.
