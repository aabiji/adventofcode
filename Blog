Day 1 -> Did it in go. The question was pretty easy, but it took me a long time since I'm new to go.
Go's fun though.

Day 2 -> Did this in go. Pretty fun.

Day 5 -> Slowly getting better at go.

Day 6 -> Still not feeling very well, but today was quite fun.

Day 8 -> Very easy.

Day 9 -> Simple problem that took me forever to get right.

Day 10 -> Didn't think my answers were right but they were! Pretty fun puzzle!

Day 13 -> Not feeling very well, and wrote an implementation, looked up other people solutions, realized mine was overly complicated (didn't need to emulate, rather clause was simply a triangle sine function).
          Interesting problem though.

Day 14 -> Part 1 was easy, while part 2 was a bit challenging.
          If you find all the set positions in the grid and recursively clear out it's neighbors, 
          you end up with a really clean solution!

Day 15 -> Surprisingly easy. Huh.

Day 17 -> Part 1 was straight forward.
         Part 2, I tried to brute force it by optimizing a little.
         Then realized that you don't need the buffer at all and that you just need to keep track of the first value, saving time on expensive split operations.

Day 22 -> A sort of cellular automata?
          Fun!

Day 23 -> Part 1 was easy while part 2 was somewhat challeging.
          Figured out that there's several layers of loop but didn't piece it together.
          Saw some hints and realized that I loop all numbers between a and b by the inner jump offset (17)
          and increment h if it's prime.
          Pretty fun though.
