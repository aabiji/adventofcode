## Day 1
Part two's answer depended on handling an edge case that wasn't in
the test inputs, but it was still pretty easy. 
I solved it sliding a window over the line
and using regex to find matches within that window.
The problem also nicely generalizes too.

# Day 2
Was really confused about the requirements. Did the rules apply per set or per game? (It was per set)
My answer kept being too low, kind of frustrating to be honest.
Maybe I'm just stupid or rusty, but I feel like the year's a lot more involed.

# Day 3
Was pretty easy once you thought about it in a certain way.

# Day 4
Part 1 was trivial
Part 2 however will need further thought. I'll do it later
(still need to do day 3 part 2 though too).
