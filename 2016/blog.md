# Advent of code 2016

In a city trying to get all 50 stars the Easter Bunny 
allegedly stole from Santa.

### Day 1
Not particularly hard, just took quite a long time. 
In part 1, I didn't parse my input properly and spent 
15 minutes trying to debug my algorithm and in part 2 
I realized I needed to increment by one instead of 
incrementing in blocks.
