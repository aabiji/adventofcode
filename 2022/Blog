# Advent of code 2022
This is where I'll write down some thoughts regarding the event.
The first days will be smooth sailing, but what I really want to 
record are the much harder days, and my approach to solving the problem.
Not bloging about _every_ day, but rather the ones that stood out to me.

Day 1 -> AOC 2022!

Day 5 -> Pretty interesting, parsing the drawing and the instructions.
Interesting problem as well.

Day 6 -> Was actually suprisingly easy. Both part 1 and part 2. Hmm.

Day 10 -> Part 2's output was actually really cool. Wonder how Eric generates inputs for all the contestants...
