Day 1: Pretty trivial

Day 2: First part was trivial. Struggled with the second part. I thought
       the question was asking if you had only 1 valid sequence with a number
       taken out, but really the question was asking if you had any number
       of valid sequences with a number taken out. So the problem wasn't actually
       hard, I just misunderstood it.

Day 3: Felt a bit too easy -- basically just basic regex

Day 4: Pretty easy

Day 5: Interesting puzzle -- I liked it. I have a creeping suspicion that my solutions aren't the most efficient though.

Day 6: Part 1 was simple. Part 2 wasn't -- just ended up brute forcing the solution. There's got to be a better way though -- the problem is obviously a graph problem.

Day 7: The problem was just a simple recursion problem to find all possible configurations of a sequence. My initial algorithm *was* correct, but integer overflowing was my problem. Using `unsigned long long` and `strtol` solved the overflowing problem.

Day 8: The question is really confusing. It doesn't make any actual sense. Slightly frustrating at first but I eventually figured out what the question was asking and the solution was really simple.

Day 9: Interesting problem. Took a lot of tries to get right. Decided to completely change my approach for part 2.

Day 10: My solution to the problem was so satisfying. Like it's basically just depth first search but with extra rules

Day 11: For the first part I was surprised that brute forcing was fast enough. The second part is a caching problem. Hashmaps to the rescue yet again.

Day 12: After some frustrating debugging I realize that when using breath first search, we need to mark the neighbor as visited *before* we visit it. Part 2 was fun to solve though.

Day 13: Basically just solving a system of equations. Struggled to answer part 2 because I wasn't checking if *both* x and y were valid integers.

Day 14: Part 1 was trivial. Part 2 was more of an open problem so I cheated a bit and quickly figured the one with the christmas tree is the one with the minimum safety. I would prefer a less open problem.
