Day 1: Pretty trivial

Day 2: First part was trivial. Struggled with the second part. I thought
       the question was asking if you had only 1 valid sequence with a number
       taken out, but really the question was asking if you had any number
       of valid sequences with a number taken out. So the problem wasn't actually
       hard, I just misunderstood it.

Day 3: Felt a bit too easy -- basically just basic regex

Day 4: Pretty easy

Day 5: Interesting puzzle -- I liked it. I have a creeping suspicion that my solutions aren't the most efficient though.

Day 6: Part 1 was simple. Part 2 wasn't -- just ended up brute forcing the solution. There's got to be a better way though -- the problem is obviously a graph problem.
